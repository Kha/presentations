* Introduction: *Lean*

- New *open source* theorem prover
- Platform for
  - *Software* verification & development
  - Formalized *mathematics*
  - *Education* (mathematics, logic, computer science)
  - *Synthesis* (proofs & programs)
- de Bruijn's Principle: *small trusted kernel*
- Expressive logic
- Partial constructions: automation fills the "holes"

* Introduction: *Lean*

- Backend for other systems
  - [[https://github.com/GaloisInc/lean-haskell-bindings][Haskell API for Lean]] developed by Joe Hendrix
- [[http://leanprover.github.io/tutorial][Interactive theory proving course]] at CMU
- [[https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/][Introduction to Logic course]] at CMU
- It is an ongoing and *long long term* effort

* Main Goal

*Lean aims to bring two worlds together*

- An interactive theorem prover with powerful automation
- An automated reasoning tool that
  - produces (detailed) proofs,
  - has a rich language,
  - can be used interactively, and
  - is built on a verified mathematical library

* Secondary Goals

- *Robust proofs*

- *Minimalist* and *high-performace* kernel

- *Education*
  - Interactive courses
  - *Proving* should be as easy as *programming*

- *Have Fun*

* Software verification and @@html:<br>@@ Formalized Mathematics

- Similar problems
  - *Proof stability*
  - Libraries are big
  - *Scalability* issues
  - Finding existing functions/theorems

- Common problems in software engineering:
  - Every attempt to create a single unified language failed (ADA?)
  - We keep reimplementing the same libraries over and over again
  - Mixing libraries from different languages is usually a mess
  - *Bit rotting*

- These problems also affect formalized mathematics

* What is new?

- Poweful *elaboration engine* that can handle
  - Higher-order unification
  - Definitional reductions
  - Coercions
  - Ad-hoc polymorphism (aka overloading)
  - Type classes
  - Tactics

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

* Dependent Type Theory

- Before we started Lean, we have studied different theorem
  provers: ACL2, Agda, Automath, Coq, HOL (family), Isabelle, Mizar, PVS

- *Dependent type theory* is really *beautiful*

- Some advantages
  - Bultin computational interpretation
  - Same data-structure for representing proofs and terms
  - Reduce code duplication, example:
    - We implemented a compiler for Haskell-like recursive equations,
      we can use it to construct proofs by induction
  - Mathematical structures (such as Groups and Rings) are first-class citizens

- Some references

* Kernel

- Kernel is implemented in two layers for easy customization

- 1st layer, dependent lambda calculus + options:
  - Proof irrelevance
  - Impredicative Prop
  #+BEGIN_SRC lean
  Π (x : nat), x = x  -- is a Proposition
  ∀ (x : nat), x = x  -- Alternative notation
  #+END_SRC

- 2nd layer: Inductive families, Quotient types, HITs

#+attr_html: :height 300px
[[./img/kernel.png]]

* Two official libraries

- *Standard*
  - Proof irrelevant and impredicative Prop
  - Smooth transition to classical logic
  - Inductive Families
  - Quotient Types

- *HoTT*
  - Proof relevant and no impredicative Prop
  - Univalence axiom
  - Inductive Families
  - HIT

- Easy to implement experimental versions,
  Example: [[https://github.com/leanprover/lean/issues/523][Steve Awodey asked for proof relevant and impredicative universe]]

* Agnostic Mathematics

- Support *constructive* and *classical* mathematics
- Computation is important to mathematics

- *Core* parts of the standard library are *constructive*

- *Separation of concerns*:
  - Methods to write computer programs
  - Freedom to use a nonconstructive theories and methods to reason about them

* Noncomputable Keyword

- Our conjecture: most users don't care about constructivism, what they really care about is whether code can be generated our not for a definition.

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
private noncomputable definition pb {s : seq} (Hs : regular s)
                                    (Hpos : pos s) :=
  some (abs_pos_of_nonzero Hs (sep_zero_of_pos Hs Hpos))

private noncomputable definition ps {s : seq} (Hs : regular s)
                                    (Hsep : sep s zero) :=
  some (abs_pos_of_nonzero Hs Hsep)

noncomputable definition s_inv {s : seq} (Hs : regular s) (n : ℕ+) : ℚ :=
  if H : sep s zero then
      (if n < (ps Hs H) then 1 / (s ((ps Hs H) * (ps Hs H) * (ps Hs H)))
        else 1 / (s ((ps Hs H) * (ps Hs H) * n)))
  else 0
#+END_SRC

* *Freedom to trust*

- Option: type check imported modules.

- *Macros*: semantic attachments for speeding up type checking and evaluation.
- Macros can be eliminated (expanded into pure Lean code).
- Each macro provides a function for computing the type and evaluating an instance.
- Each macro can be assigned a *trust level*.
- Many applications: interface with the GNU multiprecision arithmetic (GMP) library.

* Freedom to trust

- *Relaxed* mode

  - Trust the imported modules have not been tampered
  - Trust all macros

- *Paranoid* mode

  - Retype check all imported modules (someone may have changed the binaries)
  - Expand all macros (the developers may have made mistakes, GMP may be buggy)

- *Stronger guarantee* Retype check everything using Lean reference type checker

  - Daniel Selsam implemented a [[https://github.com/leanprover/tc][reference type checker]] in Haskell

* Exporting libraries

- All Lean files can be exported in a very simple format

- [[https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/doc/export_format.md][Documentation is available on github]]

- Communicate with other tools

- Interface with the [[https://github.com/leanprover/tc][Lean reference type checker]]

- [[https://github.com/GaloisInc/lean-haskell-bindings][Haskell API]] can be used to import libraries, browse and construct terms, parse files, etc.

- [[https://github.com/leanprover/lean/tree/master/src/api][We also have a C API]]

* Standard library

The standard library already contains
- datatypes: booleans, lists, tuples, finsets, sets
- number systems: nat, int, rat, real, complex
- the algebraic hiearachy, through ordered fields
- "big operations": finite sums and products, etc
- elementary number theory (e.g. primes, gcd’s, unique factorization, etc.)
- elementary set theory
- elementary group theory (Sylow’s theorem)
- beginnings of analysis: topological spaces, limits, continuity,
  the intermediate value theorem

* Standard library

Currently working on:
- topology (connectedness, compactness)
- linear algebra
- analysis: transcendental functions, the Frechet derivative
- measure theory (Lebesgue integration)
- group theory

* Recursive equations

  - *Recursors* are *inconvenient* to use.
  - Compiler from *recursive equations* to *recursors*.
  - Two compilation strategies: *structural* and *well-founded* recursion

  #+BEGIN_SRC lean
  definition fib : nat → nat
  | fib 0     := 1
  | fib 1     := 1
  | fib (a+2) := fib (a+1) + fib a

  example (a : nat) : fib (a+2) = fib (a+1) + fib a :=
  rfl
  #+END_SRC

  - Proofs by induction

* Recursive equations

 - Dependent pattern matching

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
definition map {A B C : Type} (f : A → B → C)
     : Π {n : nat}, vector A n → vector B n → vector C n
| map nil     nil     := nil

definition zip {A B : Type}
     : Π {n}, vector A n → vector B n → vector (A × B) n
| zip nil nil         := nil
| zip (a::va) (b::vb) := (a, b) :: zip va vb

* Tactics

  - Automation such as rewrite engines, simplifiers and decision procedures are integrated into
    the system as tactics.
  - A placeholder/hole can be viewed as a *goal*
  - A *proof state* is a sequence of goals, substitution (already solved holes), and postponed constraints.
  - A *tactic* is a function from proof state to a *lazy stream of proof states* (very similar to Isabelle).
  - *Tacticals* are tactic combinadors: *andthen*, *orelse*, *par*, ...

* Structures

  - Special kind of inductive datatype (only one constructor)
  - Projections are generated automatically
  - "Inheritance"
  - Extensively used to formalize the algebraic hierarchy
  - We can view them as *parametric modules*

  #+BEGIN_SRC lean
  structure has_mul [class] (A : Type) :=
  (mul : A → A → A)

  structure semigroup [class] (A : Type) extends has_mul A :=
  (mul_assoc : ∀a b c, mul (mul a b) c = mul a (mul b c))

  ...

  structure group [class] (A : Type) extends monoid A, has_inv A :=
  (mul_left_inv : ∀a, mul (inv a) a = one)
  #+END_SRC

* Type classes

  - *Synthesis* procedure based on *lambda-Prolog*

  - Big picture
    - Mark some inductive families as *classes*
    - Mark some definitions as (generators of) *instances*
    - Indicate that some implicit arguments must be synthesized using type classes

  - *Instances* are treated as *Horn clauses*

* Inhabited Type Class

  #+BEGIN_SRC lean
  inductive inhabited [class] (A : Type) : Type :=
  mk : A → inhabited A

  definition default (A : Type) [h : inhabited A] : A :=
  inhabited.rec (λ a, a) h

  definition prop_inhabited [instance] : inhabited Prop :=
  inhabited.mk true

  definition nat_inhabited [instance] : inhabited nat :=
  inhabited.mk nat.zero

  definition fun_inhabited [instance]
     (A B : Type) [inhabited B] : inhabited (A → B) :=
  inhabited.mk (λ x : A, default B)

  definition prod_inhabited [instance]
        (A B : Type) [inhabited A] [inhabited B] :
        inhabited (A × B) :=
  inhabited.mk (default A, default B)

  eval default (nat → nat × Prop)
  -- λ (a : nat), (0, true)
  #+END_SRC

* Decidable Type Class

- An element of =Prop= is said to be
decidable if we can decide whether it is true or false.

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
inductive decidable [class] (p : Prop) : Type :=
| inl :  p → decidable p
| inr : ¬p → decidable p
#+END_SRC

- Having an element =t : decidable p= is stronger than having an element =t : p ∨ ¬p=

- The expression =if c then t else e= contains an implicit argument =[d : decidable c]=.

- If Hilbert's choice is imported, then all propositions are decidable (smooth transition to classical reasoning).

* Decidable Type Class

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
definition ball (n : nat) (P : nat → Prop) : Prop :=

* Automation in Lean

- Joint work with Daniel Selsam (Stanford)
- *Work in Progress*
- Collection of proof procedures
  - Congruence closure
  - E-matching
  - Arithmetic
  - Ordered rewriting
  - Completion and superposition calculus
- SMT/ATP procedures for dependent type theory.
- *Indexing*

* Automation (main challenges)

- Many different settings
  - Constructive vs *Classical*
  - Semi-constructive axioms: *propext*, *quotients/funext*
  - Proof relevant vs *proof irrelevant*
  - *Impredicative Prop*

- Dependent types

- Type classes

* Congruence closure

- It is in the kernel of most SMT solvers (e.g., CVC4, MathSAT, Yices, Z3)

- Efficient procedure for equality

* Congruence closure + Heuristic instantiation

- Heuristic instantiation: adds instances of lemmas to local context.

- Simple and effective (used by many SMT solvers).

- "Context as a black board".

- *Indexing*.

- Avoids many technical issues.

* Congruence closure and dependent functions

- Equality type
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
variables A : Type
variables a b : A

a = b
-- is notation for
eq A a b
#+END_SRC

- Congruence closure is easy for non-dependent functions.

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
lemma congr {A B : Type} {f g : A → B} {a b : A} :
      f = g → a = b → f a = g b
#+END_SRC

- Dependent functions

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
variables (A : Type) (B : A → Type) (f : Π a : A, B a)
variables (a b : A)

-- The following equality is not type correct
check f a = f b
check f a : B a
check f b : B b
#+END_SRC

* Casts

- Cast operation
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
variables (e : a = b) (t : B a)
check e ▸ t
-- e ▸ t : B b
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
lemma dcongr {A : Type} {B : A → Type} {f g : Π a : A, B a} {a b : A}
             (e₁ : f = g) (e₂ : a = b) : e₂ ▸ (f a) = g b
#+END_SRC

* Heterogeneous equality

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
variables A B : Type
variables a : A
variables b : B

a == b
-- is notation for
heq A a B b
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
lemma dcongr {A : Type} {B : A → Type} {f g : Π a : A, B a} {a b : A}
             (e₁ : f = g) (e₂ : a = b) : f a == g b
#+END_SRC

- Heterogeneous to Homogeneous

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
variables A : Type
variables a b : A
a == b → a = b
-- We need UIP, K-axiom or proof irrelevance
#+END_SRC

* Congruence for heterogeneous equality

- Next problem: following lemma is not provable without assuming another axiom.

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
lemma hcongr {A A' : Type} {B : A → Type} {B' : A' → Type}
             {f : Π a : A, B a}
             {g : Π a : A', B' a}
             {a : A} {b : A'} :
             f == g → a == b → f a == g b
#+END_SRC

* Congruence for heterogeneous equality

- BUT, the following family of lemmas is

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
lemma hcongr_n
      {A₁ : Type}
      {A₂ : A₁ → Type}
      ...
      (f g: Π a_1 ... a_n, B a_1 ... a_n) :
      f = g → a_1 == b_1 → ... → a_n == b_n →
      f a_1 ... a_n == f b_1 ... b_n
#+END_SRC

* Example : Vectors

- Induction + Congruence closure + Heuristic instantiation is
  already quite useful.

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
inductive vector (A : Type) : nat → Type :=
| nil {} : vector A zero
| cons   : Π {n}, A → vector A n → vector A (succ n)

definition append : Π {n m : nat}, vector A n → vector A m → vector A (n + m)
| 0        m []     w := w
| (succ n) m (a::v) w := a :: (append v w)

notation ⟨ a ⟩ := cast (by blast) a

definition reverse : Π {n : nat}, vector A n → vector A n
| 0     []        := []
| (succ n) (x :: xs) := ⟨ reverse xs ++ [x] ⟩

theorem reverse_reverse : ∀ {n : nat} (v : vector A n),
            reverse (reverse v) = v :=
by blast

theorem reverse_append : ∀ {n m : nat} (v : vector A n) (w : vector A m),
        reverse (append v w) == append (reverse w) (reverse v) :=
by blast
#+END_SRC

* Example : Vectors

- In the =reverse_append= theorem, we reach the following proof state
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
(A : Type) (n₁ n₂ : ℕ) (x₁ x₂ : A) (v₁ : vector A n₁) (v₂ : vector A n₂)
(IH : rev (app v₁ (x₂::v₂)) == app (rev (x₂::v₂)) (rev v₁))
⊢ rev (app (x₁::v₁) (x₂::v₂)) == app (rev (x₂::v₂)) (rev (x₁::v₁))
#+END_SRC

- Given basic lemmas about how to push =app= and =rev= in over =cons=, a lemma stating the associativity of =app=, and a few basic lemmas about natural numbers, our congruence closure procedure together with the e-matcher can solve this goal. Once the e-matcher establishes the following ground facts:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
H₁ : rev (x₁::v₁) == app (rev v₁) (x₁::nil)
H₂ : app (x₁::v₁) (x₂::v₂) == x₁::(app v₁ (x₂::v₂))
H₃ : rev (x₁::(app v₁ (x₂::v₂))) == app (rev (app v₁ (x₂::v₂))) (x₁::nil)
H₄ : app (app (rev (x₂::v₂)) (rev v₁)) (x₁::nil) ==
     app (rev (x₂::v₂)) (app (rev v₁) (x₁::nil))
#+END_SRC


* Congruence closure and proof relevance

- In HoTT mode (proof relevant), the previous solution doesn't work.
- No general solution so far.
- The basic idea is the same: *generate custom congruence lemmas*.
- We can handle many *special cases*.
- Examples:
   - Indices are h-Sets (nat is a hSet).
   - Parameters that are mere propositions (h-Props) can be ignored.

* Future work

  - More automation
  - Efficient evaluator
  - Code generator
  - Unification hints
  - Simpler tactic framework
  - Quotation
  - Better libraries (ongoing work)

* Thank you
