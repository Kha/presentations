Superposition prover
====================

- [usage.lean](usage.lean): shows the basic usage of the super tactic

- [clauses.lean](clauses.lean): shows the data structure used for clauses

- [assoc.lean](assoc.lean): support for associative-commutative function symbols, as an example we show how to obtain the right inverse from the left inverse in monoids

- [listex.lean](listex.lean): reasoning about membership in lists, using the [same examples that we used for backchaining](../backchaining)

- [heapex.lean](heapex.lean): proving a lemma about the disjoint union of heaps in separation logic, [that we proved before using E-matching](TODO)
