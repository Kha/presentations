/- Goals:

- If you can program, then you can also prove
    * If you like to build things (programs, castles in minecraft, etc),
      you will like it.

    * I meet all the time with amazing kids that know how to program,
      but don't know how to prove.

- Definitions are important
    * sqrt(-4)*sqrt(-9)    -6 and 6
    * Nat subset Int subset Rational subset Real

- Precision is important
  - Intuition will not take us very far.
  - If you are confused, things are not clear, *THEN* formalize.

- Show you how beautiful dependent type theory is.
  - Curry-Horward correspondence.

  - It is the assembly language for representing mathematical knowledge,
    software verification problems.

  - Simulate advanced programming languages features: type classes,
    pre-conditions, contracts, subtypes, refinement types.

- Equality

- Recursion and induction are manifestations of the same principle.
